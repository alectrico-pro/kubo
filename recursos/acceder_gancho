Headers

Many client software apps (e.g., Postman) take the username:password parameter and build the authentication header automatically. If you need to build it yourself, here are the basic steps:

    Create the username:password string.
    Use your favorite tool to base64-encode the string.

The base64 encoding for the default username and password string admin:secret results in YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0, so the admin credentials will be Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0.
